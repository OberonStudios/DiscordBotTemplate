Discord.js bot template

### Documentation

#### Getting started

First, make sure your system has node and npm installed. Then, clone repo and in project root directory run:

```bash
npm i
``` 

Next step is to create new application on [Discord Developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), and generate token for your bot. You should consult with Discord docs in that regard.

After obtaining your token, add it to your config.json, so that it looks like that:
```javascript
{
  "token": "AdffdfdsdfADADFAdafefd3453tdssa4pyGSERGeargfewgf49"
}
```

Congratulations! Now you start using your Discord bot!

#### Running

To start bot, simply run:
```bash
npm app.js
```
